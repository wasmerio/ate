“Fork Clause” License Condition v1.0

The Software is provided to you by the Licensor under the License, as defined
below, subject to the following condition.

Without limiting other conditions in the License (^1), the grant of rights under
the License will not include, and the License does not grant to you, the
right to Fork the Software.

For purposes of the foregoing, “Fork” means modified copies of the Software
source code outside of the direct Control of the Licensor either with or
without their consent. "Control" includes, but is not limited to, access
rights, ownership, visibility and any other form of authentication or
authorization to read, write or modify the copied source code.

This clause is exempt in the scenario that you are developing a patch to be
contributed back to source code that remains under the direct control of
the Licensor, this exemption is under the strict condition that contribution
is the sole and only purpose of modification and that use of the uncontrolled
modified software be only for testing purposes related to the patch that will be
contributed back to the Licensor.

The Licensor reserves the right, that upon request, you permanently delete
any Modified copies of this software at any time without notice, except for
copies that are considered unmodified copies of the original source code in
its current or previous form. "Previous Form" means the source code that is
or was under the direct control of the licensor when it was copied. "Modified"
means all files that make up this specific source code collection, whereas new
or unrelated files are exempt from the definition of Modified.

^1: In the scenario that this Clause and other licenses are found to be in
conflict then the Fork Clause will override and take preference over any
conflict of interests and/or conditions.
